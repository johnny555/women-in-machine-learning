# women-in-machine-learning
Notebooks config and other stuff to help run the PMLG Women in ML wrokshop

## Approach

We are going to run through [Lesson 1 of the Fast.ai course v2](http://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson1.html).

Then, we are going to facilitate the attendees to work through 3
interesting kaggle competitions that are very similar to the cats vs
dogs example.

The aim is that at the end of the workshop the participants will have
built their own ML models.
