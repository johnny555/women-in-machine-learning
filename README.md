Notebooks config and other stuff to help run the PMLG Women in ML wrokshop

## Approach

We are going to run through Lesson 1 of the Fast.ai course v2. 

Then, we are going to facilitate the attendees to work through 3 interesting kaggle competitions that are very similar to the cats vs dogs exmaple. 

The aim is that at the end of the workshop the participants will have build their own ML models.
